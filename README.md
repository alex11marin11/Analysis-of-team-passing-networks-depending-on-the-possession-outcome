# Analysis of team passing networks depending on the possession outcome
This repository contains the code and report for the Sports Analytics Postgraduate Final Project titled "Analysis of team passing networks depending on the possession outcome". The project was developed by Marc Estévez Inglada and Alex Marin Felices under the supervision of Javier Martín Buldú and Sergi Nadal Francesch.

## Report
The report is available in a pdf format and summarizes the findings of the analysis and includes visualizations of the data together with the conclusions extracted from this project.

## Code
The code used for the analysis is included in the `Project_Passing_Networks.ipynb` file. It is written in Python in a Jupyter Notebook and uses several libraries, including Pandas and Matplotlib. The code is well-commented to make it easy to understand and modify.

## Logos
The `logos 200x200` folder contains various team logos that were used in the plots of the report. These images were sourced from LaLiga website and are free to use for non-commercial purposes.
